## IoT Solution — Excellent

WeatherTop-IoT provides an IoT solution focused on environmental monitoring.
The system represents a realistic use case where a weather station produces
data that must be transmitted, processed, and visualised across a network.

An edge node simulates sensor readings and publishes both telemetry data and
events. This approach allows the project to focus on IoT communication and
system behaviour rather than physical hardware complexity.

## Networking / IoT Technologies — Excellent

The project makes effective use of networking and IoT technologies, including:

- MQTT publish/subscribe messaging for communication between devices
- Event-driven architecture to handle telemetry and alert events
- HTTP/REST communication with a cloud IoT platform (ThingSpeak)
- TCP/IP networking for communication across distributed components
- Packet Tracer to model and document the network topology

These technologies are used appropriately and reflect common practices in
real-world IoT systems.

## Combined Knowledge — Excellent

This project combines knowledge from several areas, including computer
networks, IoT architecture, distributed systems, and backend web development.

Networking concepts are integrated with application logic, cloud services,
and data persistence. The project shows how different technologies work
together as part of a complete IoT system, rather than as isolated components.

---

## Communication — Excellent

The project is communicated clearly through a well-structured GitHub repository.
Documentation is provided using README files and dedicated documentation folders,
including explanations of networking decisions and protocol usage.

The repository also includes Packet Tracer artefacts, screenshots, and a
video demonstration. The video explains both the system architecture and
the networking aspects of the project in a clear and structured way.

## Additional Comments

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of networking using connected
devices. Simulation is used intentionally to prioritise communication protocols,
event-driven behaviour, and cloud integration. Overall, the project aligns well
with the learning objectives of the Computer Systems and Networks module.
